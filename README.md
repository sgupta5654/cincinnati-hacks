# cincinnatiHacks

> This repo is to share all files, code, and ideas for the Cincinnati hackathon. Check on updates on here and if you ever are wondering what to work on, check here. We'll use this as the file manager during the hackathon. Links, bits of code, or parts of the project should be uploaded to GitHub when edited. Paste working/helpful code into the playground. Post any apps you guys work on this week on the repo so I know what you guys have done/are doing. This will be helpful for future hackathons too.

### Ideas
 - App for instructional videos using AR, as well as real time support (think tutoring but with AR, so the teacher draws to help you, will have a similar pitch as Peloton, can be used for work and sports)
 - App for disabled people. Would potentially include volunteer help, sign language -> text (using video feed) and back (using 3d model, potentially ARKit), disability controls for those who lack fine motor skills (using the video feed hand scanning or large easy to use controls for mentally disabled), translates different sign languages
 - ~~App for crypto investment managment (idk where to go with this but I can ask a kid I know who works at a crypto company if you guys are interested in this one)~~ this one isn't a legitmate idea until the guy responds, so ignore it for now
 - AR game (platformer, can be mario-esque or like crossy road)
 - Different AR game (like Pokemon Go)
 - game with sword motion controls
 - Apple Watch App (fitness analysis, put a different spin on it)
 - multiplayer syncable game (slide phones together to play game)

### Stuff to do/google
 - learn Git commands
 - practice Swift programming in the playground
 - look at coreML/ARKit in extra time
 - Human Interface Design
 - Look at Unity for making a game (easier than Swift for a more complex ARKit game)
 - figure out how to animate 3d object (make them work like animojis)
... add more

_Right now I'm mostly gravitating towards the idea about using AR drawing for tutoring and stuff. The crypto app would essentially be an easy to use interface for checking up on currency (think serious market data in easy to view visuals) and a sort of compilation of all the different crypto wallets a person might have._
#### DESIGN NOTES FOR AR TUTORING APP
- modern (SwiftUI?) design for viewing videos, instructors' profiles, and categories for tutoring
- We should model the video chat like Facetime, with a toolbar for drawing and placing objects
- easy/interesting to use switcher between tutoring and prerecorded videos (maybe just a nav bar at the bottom of the screen like youtube, with an extra icon for facetime)
> A bonus could be handtracking and gesture controls to use when doing AR activities.

> Some selling points that we should demonstrate in the presentation are the multi-platform support, as well as support for headsets like google cardboard; ease of use, mainly showing how you can set up your phone and get going; we can do a live tutoring demo, only if we have that working; and I can try to skype my camp instructors for a little review/quote to show in our presentation. 
***Avi if you're reading this, it should look like a kickstarter ad like in one of those 'Top 10 coolest travel items' videos or whatever.
